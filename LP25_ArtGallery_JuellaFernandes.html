                Waterfalls are natural features where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of drops in the
                course of
                a stream or river. They are often characterized by their beauty, power, and the mesmerizing sound of
                cascading water.Waterfalls are typically formed when a river or stream encounters a change in the
                landscape,
                such as a cliff or a steep descent. The force of gravity causes the water to plunge over the edge,
                creating
                a waterfall. Types of Waterfalls:

                Vertical Waterfalls: The water drops vertically, forming a clear and distinct fall.
                Horsetail Waterfalls: The water maintains contact with the rock as it falls, resembling a horse's tail.
                Plunge Waterfalls: Water descends vertically without maintaining contact with the underlying surface.
                Cataracts: Powerful, large waterfalls with a series of drops.Popular Waterfalls:

                Niagara Falls: Located on the border between the United States and Canada, Niagara Falls is one of the
                most
                famous and powerful waterfalls in the world.
                Victoria Falls: Found on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is one of the largest
                waterfalls
